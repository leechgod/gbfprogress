# Shiva Checklist
![Image of Shiva Raid](https://gbf.wiki/images/7/73/BattleRaid_Shiva_Impossible.png)
## Colossus FLB
Top priority to complete

## Colossus Canes
3 ULB Colossus Canes. This is the core of the standard M2 fire grid.  
4 ULB Colossus Canes. Most grids will probably only use 3, farm 4th if you don't have a ULB opus or don't need to use a shiva sword.  

## Shiva Swords
1 Shiva Sword. Having a shiva sword is often nifty for a bit of hp at the cost of some damage, but provides some DA in return.  
3 Shiva Swords. Allows you to get more HP if you ever need it. Low priority.
